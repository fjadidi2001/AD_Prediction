## Abstract
CycleGAN has been leveraged to synthesize a CT image from an available MR image after trained on unpaired data. Due to the lack of direct constraints between the synthetic and the input images, CycleGAN cannot guarantee structural consistency and often generates inaccurate mappings that shift the anatomy, which is highly undesirable for downstream clinical applications such as MRI-guided radiotherapy treatment planning and PET/MRI attenuation correction. In this paper, we propose a cycle-consistent and semantics-preserving generative adversarial network, referred as CycleSGAN, for unpaired MR-to-CT image synthesis. Our design features a novel and generic way to incorporate semantic information into CycleGAN. This is done by designing a pair of three-player games within the CycleGAN framework where each three-player game consists of one generator and two discriminators to formulate two distinct types of adversarial learning: appearance adversarial learning and structure adversarial learning. These two types of adversarial learning are alternately trained to ensure both realistic image synthesis and semantic structure preservation. Results on unpaired hip MR-to-CT image synthesis show that our method produces better synthetic CT images in both accuracy and visual quality as compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) unpaired MR-to-CT image synthesis methods.

## Summary

### Snapshot
The study presents a novel approach, CycleSGAN, for unpaired MR-to-CT image synthesis, which incorporates semantic information into CycleGAN using a pair of three-player games, resulting in superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### Key findings
The key findings of the study include the development of a novel CycleSGAN method that outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and visual quality, and the demonstration that only a limited number of semantic annotations are needed to train the structure adversarial learning.
The study finds that CycleSGAN outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods, including 3D-CycleGAN, 3D-MINDCycle, and MUNIT, in terms of segmentation score and image-based metrics. The study also finds that CycleSGAN requires limited supervision, with 10 annotations sufficient to learn the label-conditional image generation.
MUNIT exhibited the worst segmentation score (S-score) results while 3D-CycleGAN, which operated on a volume-level rather than on a slice-level as in MUNIT, demonstrated an average Dice Overlap Coefficient (DOC) increase of 6.61% and an average Average Symmetric Surface Distance (ASSD) decrease of 0.48 mm when compared to MUNIT

##  Builds on previous research
- Similarly, after training, we extracted 2D slices along the coronal view from the 3D testing MR images, which were then fed to the trained MUNIT model to get the synthetic CT slices. ==Subsequently, we placed the synthetic 2D slices back into the original 3D space for a volume-level evaluation==; (2) 3D-CycleGAN: CycleGAN ([^Zhu_et+al_2017_a]) is another unsupervised image-to-image translation method based on cycle-consistency.
- We thus chose to use ResNet as the backbone network. In ==this study, we investigated two different backbone generators==: ResNet ([^He_et+al_2016_a]) (referred to as Ours) and U-Net ([^Ronneberger_et+al_2015_a]) (referred to as Ours (U-Net)).

## Differs from previous work
- Thus, [^Cai_et+al_2019_a]) proposed to add simultaneously trained a target-domain segmentor to enhance shape-consistency. ==However, a careful analysis reveals that the same criticism that they raise for cycle-consistency can also be applied here, i==.e., when the translated image with geometric distortion is fed to the target-domain segmentor, the distortion can be recovered without provoking any penalty in the segmentation cost, leading to sub-optimal synthesized images.
- To address the intrinsic ambiguity of cycle-==consistent reconstruction with respect to geometric transformation in CycleGAN, other works introduced shape consistency ([^Cai_et+al_2019_a]; [^Phan_et+al_2023_a]), anatomy regularization ([^Chen_et+al_2020_a]), structural similarity ([^Hiasa_et+al_2018_a]), structure consistency ([^Yang_et+al_2020_a]) and deformation correction layers ([^Wang_et+al_2021_a]). However, a careful analysis reveals that the same criticism that they raise for cycle-consistency can also be applied here, i==.e., when the translated image with geometric distortion is fed to the target-domain segmentor, the distortion can be recovered without provoking any penalty in the segmentation cost, leading to sub-optimal synthesized images. .

## Counterpoint to earlier claims
- The joint distribution is represented as a channel-wise concatenation of images and their corresponding multi-label annotation masks where each voxel has a distinct label. ==Unlike the conventional CycleGAN== ([^Zhu_et+al_2017_a]), which is restricted to the two-player framework, CycleSGAN adopts a three-player game in each domain.
